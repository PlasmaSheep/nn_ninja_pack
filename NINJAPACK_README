== Introduction ==

= What Is It? =
The ninja pack is a simple no risk, drop-in solution for getting your Nexuiz configured like a ninja. The ninja pack breaks down useful configuration scripts into a logical framework. This giving you an out of the box solution with advanced configuration options in a module based system.


= What does it offer? =

Demo Management - Take advantage of Nexuiz's built in demo review/recording features with loadable keybinds.
Weapon Mangement - Utilizing the Nexuiz 'bestweapon' function which allows weapon fallbacks, this pack has broken down the weapon management into logical divisions of use.
Team Messages - Enhanced defaults and mousewheel messages.
Variable FOV - Change your field of view with your mousewheel.
HUD ehancements - An enhanced HUD, netgraph, fps and speedometer.
Very Customizable - Your current binds will run on top of it! If you already use 'autoexec.cfg', just rename it to 'personal_binds.cfg" and it will take priority over the ninja pack keybinds / scripts.


== To Install/Uninstall ==
NB: The ninja pack uses an autoexec.cfg file. If you already have an autoexec.cfg, please rename it to 'personal_binds.cfg' so they will automagically run. 'personal_binds.cfg' has priority over the ninja binds.

= Install =
1. Back up your 'config.cfg' located in your Nexuiz data directory.
$ cp ~/.nexuiz/data/config.cfg ~/.nexuiz/data/config.cfg.bak

2. Back up your 'autoexec.cfg' (if you have anything there).
$ cp ~/.nexuiz/data/autoexec.cfg ~/.nexuiz/data/autoexec.cfg.bak

3. Download the ninja pack to your Nexuiz data directory.

4. (Optional) Overwrite 'personal_binds.cfg' with 'autoexec.cfg'
$ cp ~/.nexuiz/data/autoexec.cfg.bak ~/.nexuiz/data/personal_binds.cfg

= Uninstall =
1. Replace 'config.cfg' with your backup
$ cp ~/.nexuiz/data/autoexec.cfg.bak ~/.nexuiz/data/autoexec.cfg

2. Move or remove the ninja pack pk3 and files

3. Rename 'personal_binds.cfg' to 'autoexec.cfg'
$ cp  ~/.nexuiz/data/personal_binds.cfg ~/.nexuiz/data/autoexec.cfg.bak

== Keybinds ==

There was a graphic of keybinds but it is outdated.

== To Configure ==

= Basic =
In game, you can change the settings for practically every bind in the pack. The first 32 are listed as userbinds in the input tab. The rest must be found by trial and error.

userbind33_description

In the console will give you the description of userbind #33. You can then bind it to a key like so:
bind j "+userbind 33"

= Intermediate =

For general Nexuiz configuration and weapon binds, drag your nn_conf.cfg out of the pack into your Nexuiz data directory and edit that.

= Advanced =

autoexec.cfg - the 'boot' file
autoexec.cfg is a file Nexuiz calls on startup. This file is used to call the 'startup' file of the ninja pack, 'nn_startup'.

nn_startup.cfg - the 'startup' file
This is used to launch other cfg files in the pack. If you make a module you'd like to contain in your pack, you should call it from this file. Modules can be added or removed from this.

nn_aliases_common.cfg - the common aliases
Aliases that are used in several places are set here. You'll find team message formatting and echo formatting aliases here, among others. Also, several teamsay aliases are stored in this file that can practically only use one location waypoint.

nn_aliases_here.cfg - the 'here' aliases
Teamsay aliases that use 'here' waypoints or similar are stored in this file.

nn_aliases_there.cfg - the 'there' aliases
Teamsay aliases that use 'there' waypoints or similar are stored in this file.

nn_aot_zoom.cfg - AceOfThumbs' variable zoom script
This is a script created by AceOfThumbs that allows you to change your FOV (field of view) by holding a key (z) and using your mousewheel to zoom in and out. It's really neat! You can adjust sensitivity and fov's in nn_conf.cfg

nn_conf.cfg - the 'general nexuiz configuration' file
This file contains general nexuiz tweaks and sensitivity / fov settings for AoT's zoom script and other scripts.

nn_ctf_messages.cfg - mousewheel message script
These messages were generated with AoT's Mouse Wheel Message tool found at http://training.nexuizninjaz.com. You can create your own mousewheel messages and add them to the pack by copying the generated code. If you choose to do this, you should load your new config through nn_startup.cfg.

Note: The keybinds for this script are technically in the nn_keybinds.cfg file but you should edit them in-game because the 'nn_install.cfg file will make them inaccessible otherwise.

nn_install.cfg - the 'single execution' file
This file executes nn_install_binds.cfg exactly once.

nn_install_binds.cfg - the 'default binds' file
This file creates a set of reasonable default binds. It is executed exactly once by nn_install.cfg. It can also be used to return to a safe config if something happens.

nn_userbind_ninjafied.cfg - aliases meet userbinds here
Aliases declared in the nn_aliases_*.cfg files and elsewhere are paired with userbinds here. The userbinds are paired with keys in nn_install_binds.cfg.

nn_video.cfg - demo playback and recording binds
This is a seperate file to allow it to be called by a button press.

personal_binds.cfg - the 'new autoexec.cfg
This file acts as the new 'onload' for Nexuiz. Put your custom binds in this file.

additions/ - the 'miscellany' folder
This contains some fun modules not necessary to the ninjapack.

additions/nn_aliases.cfg - the aliases file
This file contains your nick aliases. It facilitates switching between them and has a safety mechanism. It changes bind colors, playermodel, and name.

additions/nn_editing_binds.cfg - the 'map testing' file
This file contains some binds that facilitate testing maps. You should probably customize these.

additions/nn_music.cfg - the 'music control' file
This file allows you to switch between your favorite cd tracks, and also play/pause the music.

additions/nn_servers_connect.cfg - the 'servers connection' file
This file contains aliases that make it easy to connect to servers. Each server network is given a two letter code, and its members get a longer code. These aliases must be used in the console, or they can be combined in a bind if you frequent a certain server.

additions/rlights.cfg - ??
???
